# Artificial-Life-Simulation
**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

An artificial life simulation that I am developing as part of my coursework for the Artificial Inteligence module.

The simulation consists of 3 different species (bushes, bunnies and foxes) that live and interact with each other thus creating a 
food chair cycle.

The bunnies and foxes have different individual traits like speed or sight and they affect their life expentancy.

I have also implemented a Genetic Algorithm in the simulation which uses the Roulette Wheel Selection to choose 2 parents from each species and then combines their traits in order to create a new offspring.
